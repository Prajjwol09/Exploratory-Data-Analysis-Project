Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)


Overview:
This project involves conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a 'layoffs' dataset using MySQL Workbench. The primary goal is to explore the dataset, uncover patterns, and derive insights that can help understand the underlying factors contributing to layoffs across various sectors.


Tools and Technologies:
MySQL: Used for querying and analyzing the data.
MySQL Workbench: Served as the workspace for performing the analysis, providing a robust environment for executing SQL scripts and visualizing results.


Dataset:
The dataset used for this analysis is a CSV file named "layoffs" which contains records related to layoffs across various industries and regions. This dataset has been pre-cleaned in a prior project to ensure accuracy and consistency in the analysis.
